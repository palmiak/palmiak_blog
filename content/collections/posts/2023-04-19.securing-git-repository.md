        text: 'The most common breach that can happen when storing files in a Git repository is the accidental inclusion of plain text credentials or secrets in the code. This can lead to significant issues if the repository is breached or made publicly available. To avoid this, developers should use scanning tools to detect hard-coded secrets and misconfigurations within their repositories automatically.'

        text: "One simple way to improve code security is to avoid hard-coding secrets. While developers might occasionally believe they need to hard-code a secret, it's usually better to use environment variables, which can be stored securely and programmatically accessed when needed. By following these best practices and using scanning tools, developers can make their Git repositories more secure and protect their code and credentials from breaches."
