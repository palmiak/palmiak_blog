title: "Let's talk about closed plugins in the WordPress repository"
updated_by: 93b8e665-714e-481d-af67-5ac201e067ef

intro: 'Have you ever wondered about closed plugins in the WordPress repository? Me neither until 3 weeks ago, when some inner discussion with Darius sparked my curiosity.'
excerpt: |-
  You have a WordPress website and installed some plugins from the official plugin repository. You are using the official repository because it's official, so it's THE repository. You feel a bit safer, also it informs you about the new versions so everything seems OK.

  But what will happen if a plugin is vulnerable? In most cases, it will be closed - no one will be able to download it and there will be a nice explanation of why it happened.
