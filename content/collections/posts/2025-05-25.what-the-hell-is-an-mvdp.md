title: 'What the hell is an mVDP?'
intro: 'Lately, I changed my role at Patchstack from Security Community Manager to mVDP Growth Manager. Apart from congratulations, I got a lot of questions "what is mVDP?". I think it''s time to explain what it is and why you should be probably interested in it.'

VDPs help organizations mitigate risk by supporting and enabling the disclosure and remediation of vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them. VDPs usually contain a program scope, safe harbor clause, and remediation method. VDPs generally cover all publicly accessible, internet-facing assets. Publicly posted VDPs suggest that the organization is unlikely to be an easy target.'
