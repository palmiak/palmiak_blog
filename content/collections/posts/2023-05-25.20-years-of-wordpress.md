title: '20 years of WordPress'
intro: "Can you imagine that WordPress is 20 years old? I can't. I still wear the t-shirt that was created for WP's 15th birthday. I also remember how we celebrated those birthday in Kalisz, during a WordUp. A lot have changed during those years."

But it doesn't change the fact that I owe a lot to WordPress and to its community and that it always will have a special place in my heart. Let me share a bit about how my adventure began and what I wish WordPress in the upcoming years."

I came back from realizing that I knew nothing. But it also inspired me - I dived deep into Sage, SCSS, Bedrock, Twig, etc. Together with Agnieszka (my wife), we really improved our flow.'
