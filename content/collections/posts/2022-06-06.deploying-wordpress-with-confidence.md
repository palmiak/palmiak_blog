        text: 'During WordCamp Europe, I had the pleasure of hosting workshops about deploying WordPress. I showed how, thanks to adding some tests, we can ensure that we won''t push bugs and errors to our production server. While the workshop recording isn''t available online yet, you can still read this article and learn almost everything that I have shown.'

It''s really horrible to look at a code where every developer wrote his part in a bit different way. Thanks to code sniffers and linters we can first set a coding standard that all developers will have to follow. The cool part is, that there are also tools that can automatically format your code according to the standard.'
